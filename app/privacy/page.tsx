                <h2 className="text-xl text-white">1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>privacypack.org</strong> allows users to create and
                    share cards showing the mainstream apps they previously used
                    and the privacy-respecting alternatives they have switched
                    to. We prioritize user privacy and aim to minimize data
                    collection.

                    2. Data Collection and Usage
                </h2>
                <h3 className="text-lg text-white">Information Collected:</h3>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Privacy Packs:</strong> Users may create and
                        share cards displaying &quot;before&quot; and
                        &quot;after&quot; app logos. These are publicly viewable
                        if shared.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>IP Addresses:</strong> We temporarily store
                        hashed IP addresses for rate-limiting purposes only.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>App Counts:</strong> We track the number of
                        times each app appears in user-created packs to display
                        aggregate counts (e.g., &quot;App X â€“ in 56
                        packs&quot;). This data is anonymized and does not
                        identify individual users.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="text-lg text-white">Usage of Information:</h3>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
                    <li>
                        Hashed IPs are used solely to prevent abuse and
                        excessive usage. We do not store the original IP
                        addresses.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        User-generated cards are visible to others only if
                        shared.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Aggregate app count data is used to provide site
                        features such as showing popularity trends. This
                        information is anonymized and not linked to any
                        individual user.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 className="text-xl text-white">3. Data Sharing</h2>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
                    <li>
                        We do not sell, trade, or otherwise share personal
                        information with third parties.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All data transmissions are encrypted using TLS to ensure
                        security and integrity between the user and the Site.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        User-shared cards may be publicly viewable, depending on
                        how users choose to share them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Aggregate app count data is displayed publicly, but is
                        anonymized and does not identify individual users.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 className="text-xl text-white">4. User Rights</h2>
                <p>
                    Users have the right to stop using the Site at any time.
                    Since we only store hashed IPs for rate-limiting and
                    aggregate anonymized app counts, there is minimal personal
                    data retained. If you wish to remove any publicly shared
                    card, you can do so through the Site interface.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-xl text-white">5. Data Security</h2>

                    <li>
                        We use TLS encryption for all communications between
                        users and the Site.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hashed IPs are stored securely and are never associated
                        with user identity beyond rate-limiting.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
                    <li>
                        Hashed IPs are retained only as long as necessary for
                        rate-limiting purposes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Aggregate app count data is retained to provide site
                        features and display popularity trends.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        User-shared cards remain publicly available until
                        removed by the user.
